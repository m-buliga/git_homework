This is a brief description about what I've learned in the Git + GitHub training :)

-----------------
Step 8: Edit the README file to include challenges, new things learned from the hands-on experience:
- when pushing to the remote repo, I had the authentication issue because it looks that GitHub is not supporting passwords for auth. So I had to generate a token and use it instead. For this, I had to google a bit and find a solution which eventually worked and I am glad that I managed to overcome that.

- I still have to practice to use confidently the commands; I still forget to add before committing :)

- currently, I still prefer the interface for doing different things in git, even though using commands look way easier. Work in progress to learn the commands and become confident about using them :D
